## Light Manager example

For the holidays we purchased a string of addressable lights. Each light in the string is addressable using a unique identifier.

We can send operations to the lights and tell them to change their configuration or settings.

The light manager is an example of the business event focused dotnet blocks architecture business blocks and system implementation pattern.


Shared project

The shared project contains the contracts - models, interfaces and operations used by internal and external actors to interact in the system.


In a real world example this is published as a nuGet assembly.
